# LaTeX Beamer Theme for HS BO Slides

This package provides a set of styles for a latex beamer theme which follows the
coporate design of the [Bochum University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hochschule-bochum.de).

## Setup / Install

The package provides a `Makefile` which installs all required files to the user `texmf` directory.
For Mac OS this is

	`/Users/USERNAME/Library/texmf/tex/latex/beamer-hsbo`

For Linux this *should be*  `/home/USERNAME/.texmf/tex/latex/beamer-hsbo` but is currently not
implemented in the Makefile, yet ;-)
